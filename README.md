## 🏁 Project Overview

Welcome, weary digital traveller!  
You now embark upon a journey through _Love Running_ – a front-end focused website created to inspire, encourage, and unite those who delight in the rhythmic thumping of trainers on tarmac.

This project was built as part of my foundational training in web development, incorporating **HTML**, **CSS**, and a dash of **JavaScript** to create a responsive, user-friendly experience. Picture it: a digital temple to the cult of cardio.

The *Love Running* website contains several enchanting sections:

3. **Events Page** – A catalogue of races and gatherings from around the globe.
4. **Sign-Up Form** – Users can register interest and join the community of fleet-footed fanatics.

## 🔮 Next Steps

Like any good marathon, this is just the beginning.
